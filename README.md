# THE TRAINYARD

## Description

In this simulated music venue web application, a user can create an account in order to purchase tickets for concerts. Their profile page displays these tickets and allows for them to edit the quantity and to receive a "refund," or delete them. If a user has a Gmail account, it is also possible to log into the application through Google (which is made possible through the implementation of Omniauth).
